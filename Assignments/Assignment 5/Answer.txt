Which option do you think works better for the search?
Write down your analysis as a print-out, or attach a txt file if you wish.

Answer: 
For me, I am getting the similar documents for both normalize option.
But the difference is the order.
And I think the no-stemming normalize option's output was better than stemming option.
Because the document on which basis I am finding the relevant docs, main focus is on 'soundtrack' and then it talks about a 'game'.
And the similar documents in No-stemming option also focusses mainly on soundtrack and later other similar documents talks about the game.
But for stemming option, the similar docs focusses more on games and less on soundtrack.

Thus, after analyzing similar document for more reviews, I was able to conclude that no-stemming output was more pertinent than stem output.
