    "Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a function \"**tokenize**\" as follows:\n",
    "   - takes a string as an input\n",
    "   - converts the string into lowercase\n",
    "   - tokenizes the lowercased string into tokens. Each token has at least two characters. A token **only contains letters (i.e. a-z or A-Z), \"-\" (hyphen), or \"_\" (underscore)**. Moreover, ** a token cannot starts or ends with \"-\" or \"_\" **. \n",
    "   - removes stop words from the tokens (use English stop words list from NLTK)\n",
    "   - returns the resulting token list as the output\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Define a function \"**sentiment_analysis**\" as follows:\n",
    "   - takes a string, a list of positive words, and a list of negative words as inputs. Assume the lists are read from positive-words.txt and negative-words.txt outside of this function.\n",
    "   - tokenize the string using NLTK word tokenizer\n",
    "   - counts positive words and negative words in the tokens using the positive/negative words lists. The final positive/negative words are defined as follows:\n",
    "     - Positive words:\n",
    "       * a positive word not preceded by a negation word (i.e. not, n't, no, cannot, neither, nor, too)\n",
    "       * a negative word preceded by a negation word\n",
    "     - Negative words:\n",
    "       * a negative word not preceded by a negation word\n",
    "       * a positive word preceded by a negation word\n",
    "   - determines the sentiment of the string as follows:\n",
    "     - 2: number of positive words > number of negative words\n",
    "     - 1: number of positive words <= number of negative words\n",
    "   - returns the sentiment \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Define a function called **performance_evaluate** to evaluate the accuracy of the sentiment analysis in (2) as follows: \n",
    "   - takes an input file (\"amazon_review_300.csv\"), a list of positive words, and a list of negative words as inputs. The input file has a list of reviews in the format of (label, title, review). Use label (either '2' or '1') and review columns (i.e. columns 1 and 3 only) here.\n",
    "   - reads the input file to get reviews as a list of (label, reviews) tuples\n",
    "   - for each review, predicts its sentiment using the function defined in (2), and compare the prediction with its label\n",
    "   - returns the accuracy as the number of correct sentiment predictions/total reviews\n",
    "    "
