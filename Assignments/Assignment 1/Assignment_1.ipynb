    "## 1. Define a function to analyze the frequency of words in a string ##\n",
    " - Define a function named \"**count_token**\" which\n",
    "     * has a string as an input \n",
    "     * splits the string into a list of tokens by space. For example, \"hello world\" will be split into two tokens ['hello','world']\n",
    "     * for the tokens, do the following in sequence:\n",
    "        * strips all leading and trailing space of each token\n",
    "        * removes a token if it contain no more than 1 character (use function *len* on each token, i.e. *len*(token)<=1)\n",
    "        * converts all tokens into lower case\n",
    "     * create a dictionary containing the count of every remaining token, e.g. {'is': 5, 'hello':1,...}\n",
    "     * returns the dictionary as the output\n",
    "     \n",
    "## 2. Define a class to analyze a collection of documents ##\n",
    " - Define a new class called \"**Text_Analyzer**\" which has the following:\n",
    "    - two variables: **input_file**, **output_file**. Initialize them using the class constructor.\n",
    "    - a function named \"**analyze**\" that:\n",
    "      * reads all lines from input_file and concatenate them into a string\n",
    "      * calls the function \"count_token\" to get a token-count dictionary \n",
    "      * saves the dictionary into output_file with each key-value pair as a line delimited by comma (see \"foo.csv\" in Exercise 10.3 for examples).\n",
    "      \n",
    "## 3. Define a function to analyze a numpy array\n",
    " - Assume we have a array which contains term frequency of each document. Where each row is a document, each column is a word, and the value denotes the frequency of the word in the document. Define a function named \"analyze_tf\" which:\n",
    "      * takes the array as an input\n",
    "      * normalizes the frequency of each word as: word frequency divided by the length of the document. Save the result as an array named **tf** (i.e. term frequency)\n",
    "      * calculates the document frequency (**df**) of each word, e.g. how many documents contain a specific word\n",
    "      * calculates **tf_idf** array as: **tf / df** (tf divided by df). The reason is, if a word appears in most documents, it does not have the discriminative power and often is called a \"stop\" word. The inverse of df can downgrade the weight of such words.\n",
    "      * for each document, find out the **indexes of words with top 3 largest values in the tf_idf array**. Print out these indexes.\n",
    "      * return the tf_idf array.\n",
    " - Note, for all the steps, ** do not use any loop**. Just use array functions and broadcasting for high performance computation.\n",

    "## Submission Guideline##\n",
    "- Following the solution template provided below. Use __main__ block to test your functions and class\n",
    "- Save your code into a python file (e.g. assign1.py) that can be run in a python 3 environment. In Jupyter Notebook, you can export notebook as .py file in menu \"File->Download as\".\n",
    "- Make sure you have all import statements. To test your code, open a command window in your current python working folder, type \"python assign1.py\" to see if it can run successfully."
